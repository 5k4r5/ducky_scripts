# README
This is a repository with scripts for bad USBs, which I have written or modified, using the ducky language. 
***
### The scripts are written for the **Malduino** bad USB, but they can also be used with a normal rubber ducky. 
* If you are going to use them on a **rubber ducky**, you need to **remove the first line of the scripts**.
