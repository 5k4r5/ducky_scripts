# README
This is a repository with scripts for bad USBs, using the ducky language, which I have written or modified. 
***
### The scripts are written for the **Malduino** bad USB, but they can be used for a normal rubber ducky. 
* If you are going to use them on a **rubber ducky**, you need to **remove the first line of the scripts**.
